<p>One day Father Porcupine
was out hunting
food. He came to a tree in
which sat a lot of monkeys
eating oranges. He asked for
some, but the unkind monkeys
only pelted him with the fruit
as hard as they could! Then
Father Porcupine laughed and
put up his quills, and the
oranges stuck on them. When
his quills were stuck full he
started for home, and he and
his family had a fine dinner.</p>

THE PLEASANT SPOT.</h2>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus04.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE PLEASANT SPOT.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There was a “pleasant
spot” in Mrs. Hall’s
parlor, and every day at just
three o’clock in the afternoon,
if they had been perfectly
good children, little Dick and
Fanny Hall could go in and
sit in that place an hour, and
nobody else could go there
at that time. The “pleasant
spot” was under the green
palm tree.</p>

<p>If they had behaved well,
Dick and Fanny always went
to their mother at ten minutes
of three to be made as “sweet
as roses.” But if they had
been naughty they never went.</p>

<p>What did they do in the
“pleasant spot?” They told
each other stories, and they
themselves made the stories.</p>

<p>Fanny’s stories were very
short ones, such as this:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One day a little small new small small baby-girl fly
went into a rose, an’ her mama was not looking, an’ she los’
her way in the rose’s leaves an’ never comed out, an’ that
little girl-fly never saw her mama any more, never, never,
never again, Dicky.”</p>
</div>

<p>Dicky’s stories were short
too, and such as this one:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Sometimes, when little boys have a toy train, just a tin
one, and they are playing with it, it turns into a live train, and the
engine puffs out live smoke, and live people travel in it. But
if their fathers and mothers look, or anybody, it is a tin train.
And this is a fairy story, Fanny.”</p>
</div>

<p>Or like this one, which
Dicky said was a “nadventure:”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One time, when three little boys went up the mountain,
they set their lunch basket down on the tip-top. In about
two minutes they heard a noise at their basket, and a chipmunk
stood there, and the chipmunk had one of their cookies
in his paws!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">BABYLAND<br>
“KEECOO CARL.”</h2>

</div>

<p>“Mama, give me a
keecoo,” said Carl.</p>

<p>“My child, there isn’t a cookie
in the house,” said Mama.</p>

<p>“Do you <i>wis’</i> you had
some?” asked Carl, planting
his chubby elbows in Mama’s
lap.</p>

<p>“Indeed I do,” said Mama.
“I certainly do wish that
when Bridget went, she had
left something in the house to
eat!”</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Carl,
with his mama’s large travelling
bag on his arm, closed the
back gate behind him, and
trudged down the street.</p>

<p>A “lovely lady” that Carl
knew lived in the first house
round the corner, and he
walked up to the front door
and rang the bell.</p>

<p>The lady herself came to
the door.</p>

<p>“Please give Carl keecoo.
Bwidget’s gone, and us haven’t
one fing in the house to eat,”
and Carl extended the open
bag to his astonished friend.</p>

<p>“Bless your heart!” she
said, drawing her little friend
in, and when he left he had
ten cookies in his bag. She
certainly was a “lovely lady”
but Carl wished she hadn’t
smiled so much with her
eyes.</p>

<p>A little further on, another
lady lived who often called to
see mama, and Carl gave her
door-bell a pull. This time
a maid came, and Carl was
shown into the parlor.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Lee came in
and heard Carl’s errand she,
too, “smiled,” and into his bag
went eight <i>beautiful</i> doughnuts.</p>

<p>Three or four more friends
were visited, and at every place
Carl’s bag grew heavier.</p>

<p>With a happy heart he hurried
home, and bursting into
the sitting-room he excitedly
empties the contents of his
bag into mama’s lap.</p>

<p>There were cookies, yellow
and brown, of all shapes and
sizes, and doughnuts both
round and square.</p>

<p><i>“Carl! Where in the
world”</i>—began mama.</p>

<p>“Yesh, isn’t you glad?”
interposed Carl. “They was
all gibbed to me for <i>you</i>,
and every buddy sent their
love!”</p>

<p>This is how “Keecoo Carl”
came by his name.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">LITTLE SALLY’S ANIMAL STORY.</h2>

</div>

<p>“Do you know any stories?”
was the first
thing Jimmy said to his little
cousin visitor.</p>

<p>“I do,” said Sally, smiling.
“What kind do you like best?”</p>

<p>“All the kinds,” said Jimmy
promptly. “Do you know any
about animals?”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>JIMMY AND SALLY.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“I do,” said Sally. “I
know a first-rate one about
my own cat.”</p>

<p>“Tell it, now,” said Jimmy.</p>

<p>“I will,” said Sally. “I will
begin it right now.”</p>

<p>Jimmy came around in
front where he could “see
every word.” “Begin!” said
he.</p>

<p>“I am beginning,” said Sally.
“My cat is just as old as I
am. We were kittens together.
Mama says she used to rock
us in the cradle. One of the
first things I remember, Jimmy,
is my cat. She is a very
big gray cat with a ringed
coon tail.”</p>

<p>“Got a name?” asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>“She has. Big Betsey.
Big Betsey goes to the country
in summer. Mama wouldn’t
think of leaving her behind
to look out for herself. And
we think, Jimmy, that Big
Betsey always knows on what
day we shall start. We think,
Jimmy, that she understands a
great many words that we say.</p>

<p>“Last summer she had a
very smart handsome
kitten, a great
pet with us all, and
we think Big Betsey
understood us
when we said we did
not think the kitten
could be taken too.
The morning we
were to start, when
Mama went upstairs,
there in one of the
trunks lay Big Betsey’s kitten,
and there Big Betsey stood
packing her as nicely as possible,
standing up on her back
feet and tucking her in with
her paws! Did you ever hear
of such a thing, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Jimmy, “I
didn’t. Did the kitten go?”</p>

<p>“She did,” said Sally.</p>

<p>“In the trunk? O, I hope
she did—<i>please</i>, cousin Sally,
please say she did!” entreated
Jimmy.</p>

<p>“She’d have smothered, Jimmy,
all locked in where she
couldn’t get any fresh air to
breathe. She and Big Betsey
went in a basket, and had part
of my seat. This is The
End, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“It’s a very nice animal
story,” said Jimmy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">BABYLAND<br>
THE KIND LITTLE CAT.</h2>

</div>

<p>Miss Howells has
told the story of Posy
Pinkham’s cat that dreamed.
This is a story of two other
cats Posy had.</p>

<p>The cats were sisters.
Their names were Fluff and
White-face. Fluff was a gentle
milk cat. White-face was
a fierce mouser. White-face
would often bite and claw her
sister, but Fluff never bit and
clawed back.</p>

<p>Once, however, Fluff bit
and clawed first, and there
was a fight, and Fluff—but
that’s the story.</p>

<p>Papa Pinkham had caught
a gray mouse in the wire cage-trap.
It was so cunning Posy
begged to keep it, and Papa
Pinkham left it in the cage-trap
and went off to business.
Posy fed the mouse with five
kernels of corn, and then went
to dress her doll Lilybell
for breakfast.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>FLUFF ALSO ADMIRES THE MOUSE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Fluff had been looking on.
Now she went close up to the
cage and sat down.</p>

<p>Just then White-face came
creeping, creeping up, in the
way of mouse-hunting
cats.</p>

<p>“Hush,” she whispered
to Floss; “there’s a
mouse; see me catch it!”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus20" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus20.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE FIGHT.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“No,” whispered Floss,
“it’s such a cunning mouse,
so soft and smooth, such bright
little eyes, such a long
slim tail—no, don’t.”</p>

<p>“I shall, I say!”</p>

<p>“No, you mustn’t—besides,
it is
Posy’s mouse.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,
I want it!”</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus21.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>UP THE TREE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Just then the
mouse moved so its tail came
through the wires. White-face
sprang, but Floss sprang
quicker, not at the tail, but
at her fierce sister.</p>

<p>White-face was very angry;
she bit and clawed terribly;
she scratched Floss across the
face—but Floss fought on.</p>

<p>At last White-face got away,
and ran out the door and up
a tree. Floss chased her and
nipped the tip
of her tail as she
climbed. Then
she ran back
to the house,
and told Posy
all about it.</p>

<p>Posy hugged the kind little
cat, and tied a beautiful ribbon
about her neck, and told her
she was brave as a lion, and
kind as—as—a little girl!</p>

<p>But White-face got no ribbon,
and no praise—and she
was so scared she staid up in
the tree all day.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">JANIE’S PONY.</h2>

</div>

<p>Little Janie came up to
her big brother. She
laid her little thin hand on his
book. “Charlie, I wish I had
something nice and new to
play with,” she said to him.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Charlie, laying
down his book. “You shall
have it. What shall it be?”</p>

<p>Little Janie had been
very ill a long time,
and now everybody was
very kind to her, very
patient. Poor little Janie!</p>

<p>“Well,” said Janie, “I
wish I had a pony to ride.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the
big brother, “you shall
have him, in just twenty
minutes. I will come
in just twenty minutes and
get you.” And off he went.</p>

<p>In about twenty-two minutes
he was back again. First he
blindfolded Janie. Then he
took her in his arms and carried
her away. Then he set her
down on—a
pony.
Then he
took off
the “blindfold.”
And then little Janie
laughed. It was indeed a very,
very funny pony on which
little Janie sat.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE OLD WHITE MANSION.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There was a day in her
baby-life that little Mary
Ellen always spoke of as “my
first day.”</p>

<p>“It was when I was a little
crib-baby, a little bye-o-baby,
you know,” Mary Ellen would
say.</p>

<p>Mary Ellen meant it was the
first day she could remember.</p>

<p>She remembered it by two
things—it was the first time
she ever heard her pretty mama
scream, and the first time
she ever got her little hands
into the fur of a cat.</p>

<p>Mary Ellen was in her crib,
in the pretty baby-room of the
big white mansion, called “The
House of the Grandmothers.”
A pink rosebush was growing
in a blue-and-white pot, a yellow
canary hung in the window,
and the sunshine was
streaming in over everything.
Mary Ellen was lying awake,
looking at the pretty window,
when all at once something
made her turn her eyes.</p>

<p>There, on the foot-rail, sat
some beautiful, furry, bright-eyed
creatures, looking at her,
and making the most lovely
noise. She smiled at them,
saying, “goo-goo-goo.” At that,
one of them hopped down on
the quilt, then came closer,
blinking its green eyes and
still making the lovely noise.
Mary Ellen’s tiny body gave a
quick little spring, and—O,
delightful!—her hands grabbed
into the soft warm fur of a kitty.</p>

<p>Then came the scream, and
mama with it, both through the
open door.</p>

<p>“Dick! mercy! come quick!
scat! scat!”</p>

<p>Not only papa came, but the
two grandmamas and one of
the great-grandmothers, all four
looking scared.</p>

<p>“They were right on the
foot-rail of her crib—the three
tiger-cats,” gasped mama, “and
one had jumped down on her!
I don’t much think they’ve
scratched her, but they might
have—just think of it, Dick!”</p>

<p>Papa Dick smiled. “Awful!”
said he. “No doubt, Nan,
they came in purposely to eat
your baby up!”</p>

<p>The grandmothers smiled
too. “Nan! as if our cats
would hurt Mary Ellen!” said
the youngest grandmother.</p>

<p>“Well, you can all laugh,”
said Mama Nan, “but I think
six cats are much too many in a
house where there’s a baby.”</p>

<i>CHAPTER II.—Mary Ellen’s Birthday Celebration.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>There were two or three
other events in her baby days
that little Mary Ellen always
wished she could remember.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp75" id="illus39" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus39.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE BIG CAT-BASKET.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One was her first birthday
celebration. It was not like
any that any other little baby
ever had. Little Mary Ellen
had a birthday when she was
six months old!</p>

<p>The youngest of the four
great-grandmothers, Mrs. Persis,
was talking one day with
Madam Esther, the next-to-the-oldest
great-grandmother.
“It is time Nan’s baby had
some kind of a celebration,”
said she. “Why not let her
have a birthday the day she is
six months old?”</p>

<p>“Who ever heard of such a
thing!” Madam Esther gasped.</p>

<p>“Why, <i>we</i> have!” laughed
Grandmother Lee, Mary Ellen’s
father’s mother. “All we
six here have heard of it, hav’n’t
we, just this very minute?”</p>

<p>“Well, this <i>is</i> an idea,” said
Grandmother Camp, Mary Ellen’s
mother’s mother. “A
birthday at six months old!
Still, if we choose, what is to
prevent? I’ll ring for Nan.”</p>

<p>They were all in Miss Persis’
room, the large southwest
corner room, in their rocking-chairs,
sitting in the sun. The
cats lay in the big cat-basket,
basking in the golden warmth.</p>

<p>When Mama Nan came in,
her mother told her the plan.
“Did I ever hear anything so
absurd!” cried Mama Nan.</p>

<p>Papa Dick said, “Why not?”
and helped the plan on.</p>

<p>So Mary Ellen had the celebration.
It was held in Mrs.
Persis’ sunny sitting-room, and
she was taken in in her best
embroidered robe and blue ribbons
with a pink rose stuck in
each bow, and the cats had
new blue ribbons with rosebuds
tied in—and what do you
think was the center-piece on
the tea-table?</p>

<p>Why, Mary Ellen herself, on
a pink sofa pillow, nestled in
among the big lace ruffles!</p>

<p>And her birthday presents?
Six white sugar-candy doves.
And when, one by one, they
were held up to her face to
see, what do you think Mary
Ellen did? At the last dove
she put out her little pink
tongue on its white breast and
had her first taste of candy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.<br>
<i>CHAPTER III.—Mary Ellen’s Christmas and New-Year’s.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Two other celebrations
followed little Mary
Ellen’s birthday as fast as
possible.
Mary
Ellen’s
mama said
the baby’s six
grandmothers
made her
dizzy with
their frolicsome
plans.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp52" id="illus41" style="max-width: 21.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus41.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE SIX STOCKINGS.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But Christmas was coming,
and certainly a baby’s first
Christmas must be celebrated.</p>

<p>Great-grandmother Day, one
of Mary Ellen’s father’s grandmothers,
said one day to Mama
Nan, “I suppose Mary Ellen
has six stockings?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I suppose so—why
do you ask?”</p>

<p>“You may hang them for
her Christmas Eve,” said the
venerable lady. “Stockings
have never been hung in this
house, but Mary Ellen probably
will have to be indulged.”</p>

<p>Great-grandmother Day was
the oldest of the four great-grandmothers.
She was a very
dignified old lady, and wore
steel-bowed spectacles and carried
a snuff-box in her pocket
with a vanilla bean in it, and
was treated with the greatest
respect throughout the house.</p>

<p>Christmas Eve, six baby
socks hung in a row in the
nursery, and what do you think
was in them next morning?</p>

<p>Six tiny packages, just
alike. There were six fifty-dollar
bank notes. Each was
labelled: “<i>To be kept for Mary
Ellen’s wedding-dress.</i>”</p>

<p>Mary Ellen’s mama looked
as if she would cry. Papa
Dick said, “I wonder what
these grandmothers will do
next!”</p>

<p>Mary Ellen’s next celebration
was on New-Year’s Day.
Nothing would do but that the
Baby must make New-Year’s
calls. Her mama feared she
might take cold from “drafts,”
being carried in and out of so
many rooms, but Papa Dick
said, “O, bundle her up!”</p>

<p>So New-Year’s morning
Mary Ellen was dressed in
her long white cashmere cape-cloak
and her white velvet
hood, and was carried about
the house, up stairs and down,
to call on her grandmothers in
their own rooms. She was
quite equal to the occasion.
She said, “Da-da, da-da!”
(“Happy New-Year!”) to
each and every one who took
her mite of a hand, and came
home to her crib with something
shut fast in her fingers
her mama did not see at all!</p>

<i>CHAPTER IV.—Mary Ellen’s Midnight Adventure.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>What it was Mary
Ellen had in her soft
little pink hand when she came
back from the New-Year’s
calls and still had in it when
she was laid in her “cribsie-nest”
New-Year’s night, nobody
knew.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp48" id="illus43" style="max-width: 20.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus43.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>“DON’T YOU SMELL PEPPERMINT?”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It was small and round and
flat and smooth. Mary Ellen
hardly felt it, and as the hand
of a little baby mostly keeps
itself shut very tight it did not
drop out, and by and by it
grew just the least bit sticky
and staid fast.</p>

<p>To be sure, when Mama
Nan was undressing her and
putting on her nightgown she
suddenly began to sniff. “I
seem to smell peppermint,” she
said, and dipped her nose
down among Mary Ellen’s
ruffles. Then she lifted her
head and sniffed all about in
the air in the funniest way.
“If she were not mine,” she
said, “I should certainly say
somebody had been giving
this child peppermint! Come
here, Dick! Don’t you smell
peppermint? Put your head
down here!”</p>

<p>Papa Dick put his nose
down in Mary Ellen’s ruffles
and sniffed. He said it did
seem as if he got a whiff of
peppermint, but perhaps babies
always smelt of peppermint.</p>

<p>“Of course she <i>hasn’t</i> had
any,” Mama Nan said at last,
and they went out and left the
baby to her dreams, and the
baby said nothing. The little
hand staid shut, and she
went to sleep.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp52" id="illus44" style="max-width: 21.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus44.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>HE FLASHED UP THE NIGHT LAMP.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>That night, suddenly, just
as the nursery clock began
striking twelve, there was an
outcry from the crib, so sharp,
so painful, that it brought
Mama Nan to her feet in the
millionth part of a second.
Papa Dick, too! He flashed
up the night lamp and then
there was a second scream,
from Mama Nan, and she
dropped in a heap by the crib.
As for Papa Dick, his hair
stood on end. He dashed at
the crib and snatched a small
mouse, a live mouse but ever
so little, from Mary Ellen’s
fingers that were clutching it
tight. In his horror he flung
it into the water-pitcher. Then
he flung the water, some of it,
and the mouse with it, into
Mama Nan’s face, for she
had fainted; and the mouse
leaped from Mama Nan’s wet
cheek and ran for his life.</p>

<p>The next minute both were
bending over Mary Ellen.
Her big blue eyes, full of
tears, were just shutting to
sleep again. A tiny pink peppermint
lay on the crib quilt.
Mama Nan pounced on it.
“What did I tell you!” she
cried.</p>

<p>Papa Dick was examining
the warm little hand. It was
very sticky and sugary. There
was a tiny red spot, like a pin-prick,
on one side of the palm.
“The mouse was after the
candy,” said he, “and she just
shut her fingers on him when
he bit—hurrah for our baby,
Nan!”</p>

<p>“<i>Bit!</i>” screamed Nan, and
for a moment she looked as if
she might faint again. “Old
Lady Lois must have given it
to her when we were upstairs
to-day—she is forever eating
peppermints! I should
think she would have known
better!”</p>

<p>But dear Old Lady Lois,
who truly was as fond of
sweets as a child, had not given
her the peppermint. She had
dropped it on her lap and little
Mary Ellen’s hand had
chanced to close over it, and
had brought it home.</p>

<p>The Grandmothers were
in Mrs. Persis’ room.
Large and sunny, it was the
favorite sitting-room, and the
big cat-basket was generally
kept there.</p>

<p>As usual they were all doing
something for Mary Ellen.
Grandmama Camp was embroidering
on a little petticoat.
The others were embroidering
too, or crocheting, except the
oldest two of the great-grandmothers.
Mrs. Day was knitting
a yarn stocking about the
size for a little girl of six, Old
Lady Lois was pasting colored
pictures in a scrap-book.</p>

<p>They were talking of the
child. “I often wonder how
she is ever going to know us
apart,” Grandmama Lee was
saying. “Six of us!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Persis laughed. “Poor
baby! who ever before heard
of six grandmothers in one
house! just how she will learn
to tell us apart <i>is</i> a question!”</p>

<p>There was Grandmama Lee,
and Great-grandmother Lee
who was called “Mrs. Persis,”
and Great-grandmother Day.
These three belonged to Papa
Dick and had lived in the
house ever since he could remember.
Grandmama Lee,
Papa Dick’s mother, was
young and plump and smiling,
with nut-brown hair waving
over her forehead—a very
nice grandmother. Great-grandmother
Lee, “Mrs. Persis,”
was roly-poly with a double
chin, puffs of white hair, bright
eyes, and any of the cats sat
on her shoulder when they
liked. Great-grandmother Day
was the one who walked with
a cane and wore caps.</p>

<p>Grandmama Camp and
Great-grandmother Camp and
Great-grandmother Gray who
was called “Old Lady Lois,”
belonged to Mama Nan, and
when Papa Dick married her
he brought them all home to
his own house. He said he
liked the idea. Mrs. Camp,
Mama Nan’s mother, was a
young, handsome, stylish woman
with black hair and
black eyes. Great-grandmother
Camp, called “Madam Esther,”
was tall and also had black
hair and black eyes. “Old
Lady Lois,” Mrs. Gray, was
quite a beautiful old lady.
She had a sweet face, and
always wore a flower in her
soft white mull kerchiefs.</p>

<p>“I think <i>I</i> know,” said
Grandmama Camp, looking
around on the others, “just how
Nan’s baby will tell us apart.”</p>

<p>“How,” they asked. But
she would not tell them.</p>

<p>One day, suddenly Mary
Ellen began to creep.</p>

<p>She was sitting on the rug,
reaching for her playthings—her
rag doll and her rag kitten.
She had tossed them too far
and there was no one in the
nursery to help get them, and
finally in her repeated reaching
forward, over she went on
her nose! Mama was not
there to set her up again and
say, “Bumpity-bump! Up she
must jump!” and she whimpered
a bit. But she wanted
her playthings, and struggling
for them she kicked her little
legs out behind her and tried
to jump along on her little
stomach. At last in her mighty
effort she drew her little knees
up under her, lifted her little
back, and away she went,
<i>creep! creep! creep!</i> and with
a very red face and a gurgle
of delight grabbed her doll and
cat. Then she tumbled down
on her face again. But finally
she got herself turned over,
and lay there on the carpet,
contented.</p>

<p>And there she still lay,
gurgling and cooing over dolly,
when Mama Nan came in,
and Grandma Camp. Mama
Nan stared at her baby, then
at the rug where the ivory
rattle and pillows lay, then at
Mary Ellen again.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?”
she cried. “She is fully ten
feet away from where I left
her!”</p>

<p>Mama Nan’s mother smiled.
“I think, Nan, that Mary
Ellen has had another adventure.
I rather think she has
been creeping!”</p>

<p>For a moment Mama Nan
looked more astonished and
bewildered than before. Then
she turned and flew out along
the little hall that led to the
library. “O, Dick!” she cried.
“Come in here! What do
you think? Mary Ellen has
been creeping.”</p>

<p>Papa Dick looked, for a
second, fully as astonished as
Mama Nan. Then he said,
“Well, it’s all right, isn’t it?
She’d have to do it sometime,
wouldn’t she?”</p>

agreed, “it must have been
quite an exhibition. Suppose
we go in and see if she can be
got to repeat the performance,”
and back to the nursery they
both hurried.</p>

<i>CHAPTER VII.—How the Parrot Helped.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>But there was something
more to be done than
just to say, “Come, Baby!
come to mama,” to get Mary
Ellen to creep again.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>“COME GET THE BOO’FUL BIRD!”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Mary Ellen’s papa, mama,
and maternal grandmama all
got down on the floor at the
opposite end of the room, and
smiled and held out hands
and coaxed and chirruped; and
Mary Ellen smiled in return
and crowed and jounced her
little self up and down, and
seemed ever so many times to
be on the very point of starting
to go, but after all did not
once make any effort to get
over on her little hands and
knees and creep. It ended
every time in her sitting there
and reaching for them to come
over and get her.</p>

<p>“She’ll never do it again,”
said Mama Nan.</p>

<p>“Perhaps she hasn’t at all,”
said Papa Dick. “She may
just have rolled there. Do
you <i>know</i> that she crept?”</p>

<p>“Oh! she crept,” said Mrs.
Camp. “I examined her
hands and knees.”</p>

<p>Now there was one thing
Mary Ellen had always
wanted more than anything
else and many times had
reached up her little hands
for—the red and green parrot
on the bronze perch. But
though the bird had an equal
curiosity about the baby,
Mama Nan would never let
Dom Pedro be brought near
her child for fear that cruel
hooked bill might bite!</p>

<p>But now, suddenly, she said,
“See here, Dick! go get the
parrot!”</p>

<p>When the bird was brought
and began to shout, “Holloa,
Young Woman!” which was
Papa Dick’s usual salutation
to his daughter, Mary Ellen
began to jump herself up and
down again and pat-a-cake in a
perfect frenzy of delight.</p>

<p>“Come get the boo’ful bird!”
called Mama Nan. “Come
to mama, baby, and have the
pretty bird!”</p>

<p>But Mary Ellen seemed to
have lost all knowledge of her
new art of locomotion. She
continued to jounce and crow,
while her papa had to grasp
hard hold of the
parrot to keep
him from flying
out of his hands.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus52.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>MARY ELLEN AND DOM PEDRO.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the midst
of the excitement
Old Lady
Lois came in.
The reason of the queer scene
was explained to her. “Bless
your hearts!” exclaimed she.
She crossed the floor, lifted
the child, poised her a moment
on her feet, then gently
laid her down, face forward;
and at that second the parrot
flapping his wings in a new
struggle to fly, Mary Ellen,
with a great crow set off on
hands and knees to meet him.</p>

<p>Quite around the nursery
she followed after her papa
and the brilliant bird. Then,
as reward, she was taken up
on her papa’s knee, and let to
lay her little hand upon the
feathery green back and to
stroke the gorgeous green and
red tail feathers. As for the
parrot—of course he did not
bite! he only said, “And what
d’ye think now, Young
Woman?”</p>

<p>After this, Mary Ellen
could creep; could creep with
the greatest velocity. But
whenever she crept, and
wherever, her journeys always
ended at the foot of the
bronze parrot-perch, and Dom
Pedro always leaned over and
spoke to her, and said as he
peered down at the golden-haired
little girlie, “Holloa,
Young Woman! holloa!”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>MARY ELLEN’S FIRST TOOTH.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Almost as soon as
Mary Ellen could
creep, she tried to walk; and on
the same day she took her first
step “all alone-y,” a little tooth
came into sight. The big
white house was in a state of
excitement. The grandmothers
were downstairs all day. Mrs.
Persis was sure she had felt
the tooth for a week. All had
to touch the bit of sharp pearl.
“I believe the little rogue
<i>knows</i> she is biting us,”
Madam Esther said as Mary
Ellen let go her finger with a
gurgle of a laugh. She pointed
out a tiny red spot on her
finger and declared the tooth
had made it. The others
came and gazed, and Papa
Dick said grandmothers were
queer beings.</p>

<p>But he and Mama Nan
“felt” the tooth, too, when once
they were alone with Mary
Ellen. They seemed to think
it very wonderful that the tiny
pearl should appear in their
baby’s mouth. They peered
at it so often during the next
few days that at last, if anyone
said, “Now let’s see ’ittle
toofy!” Mary Ellen began to
cry and scream.</p>

<p>After Mary Ellen could
creep she wouldn’t stay on her
rug. She would hitch along
until off, and then start to
creep. Next minute up she
would raise her little body and
walk off, all-fours, on hands
and feet, pounding along like
a little dog until she got to a
chair, when she would pull herself
upright. Then, with her
little hands patting the chair-seat
joyfully, she would step
about it as fast as she could
go, jumping, gurgling and
crowing, until in her wild glee
down she would tumble! And
one day, in climbing up after a
tumble, she found the chair
could walk too! Mary Ellen
made experiments. A good
smart push, and off the chair
would start over the smooth
floor, and Mary Ellen with it,
crowing like a little rooster.</p>

</figure>

<p>Suddenly, one morning
Mary Ellen appeared to have
an idea in her little head. She
had been left on the rug with
her playthings. There was no
one in the room except the
cats and Dom Pedro. The
cats raced about, and Dom
Pedro scolded: “Scat! Scat!
Less noise I say!” Mary
Ellen took no notice. She
set off, hitching along, for the
door open into the hall. As
soon as she was over the
threshold she started on a fast
creep for the stairs.</p>

<p>“Young Woman!” Dom
Pedro called. Mary Ellen
crept on, the cats frolicking
along with her. Dom Pedro’s
perch stood where he had a
good view of the stairs, and
now, as Mary Ellen laid her
little hand on the bottom step
he burst into a perfect frenzy
of hoarse calls and squeaks.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus57.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>SHE CAME TO A DOOR.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Mary Ellen paid no
attention to Dom
Pedro’s cries. She pressed
one fat hand down hard on the
first stair and steadied herself
and straightened herself up
until her little knees were level
with the step, and then on it—and
there she was, <i>up a
stair</i>! Her little face was
very red, and she was very
puffy all over. But she
seemed to have an instinct as
to what to do next. Or perhaps
she had studied it all out
on her rug. Learned men are
trying to pry into the minds
of babies now, but as yet none
has discovered <i>very</i> much as
to what a baby thinks of, or
whether it thinks anything.
She grasped hold of a baluster-round
with one hand and
laid a sturdy little knee on the
next stair, and in this way up
she went, panting and puffing
and getting on up, she and the
kittens, but never making a
loud sound, excepting a little
grunt now and again.</p>

<p>But the moment she reached
the top she broke out into a
delighted gurgle of little
words: “Gum-um! gum-um!”
Then she got herself on her
feet—a very dusty, mussed-up,
red-faced, white-frocked baby,
her sunshiny hair wet on her
heated forehead, but her blue
eyes sparkling. She steadied
herself in her little red kid
slippers and then, her hands
against the wall, she stepped
along, step by step, until she
came to a door. On that she
spatted with her two little
hands and said, “Gum-um!
gum-um!”</p>

<p>There was a sudden hurry
inside, and the door opened,
and Mary Ellen and the six
kittens went tumbling in
together down on the floor.
Great-Grandmother Day cried
out, “The Good Lord preserve
us!” and sank back in
a chair.</p>

<p>The next minute she had
caught the child up. Mary
Ellen was crying lustily, for
she had bumped her nose in
a very bad way, and as Great-Grandmother
Day sank back
with her in the chair again,
doors flew open all about and
grandmothers came flying
along from all quarters.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp52" id="illus58" style="max-width: 21.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus58.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>MAMA NAN LOOKED WHITE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“What is it? Is Mary
Ellen here? What is the
matter?”</p>

<p>Great-Grandmother Day addressed
herself to Madam Esther.
“I know you keep
brown paper by you—bring
me a piece of brown paper
wet in ice water for this child’s
nose.”</p>

<p>At this moment, brought by
Mary Ellen’s shrill screams
and the parrot’s outcry, Mama
Nan appeared flying up the
stairs.</p>

<p>“What is it? Where is
Mary Ellen? Have you got
Mary Ellen up here?”</p>

<p>She entered just as the piece
of brown paper was being laid
on Mary Ellen’s nose, and her
words ended in a little shrill
cry like that of a frightened
mother-bird.</p>

<p>“This child came up the
stairs alone!” said Great-Grandmother
Day, severely,
speaking to all in the room.
She rose and delivered the
child to its mother and then,
faint for the first time in her
life, was led back to the chair
by Old Lady Lois and Mrs.
Lee.</p>

<p>By this time Mary Ellen
was snuggling down in her
mother’s neck in great content,
and her sobs were ceasing.
But poor Mama Nan looked
very white. “I shall never
know another moments peace,”
she said piteously.</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said her mother.
“You did the very same thing
yourself, Nan. You were just
about the age of Mary Ellen.”</p>

<p>On the way downstairs,
Mary Ellen raised her head
and said, “Gum-um! gum-um!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did go to see
Gum-um,” answered her mama;
“but you mustn’t do it again.”</p>

<i>CHAPTER X.—The Vase of Flowers.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>None of the “gum-ums”
supposed Mary Ellen
would try coming up stairs
again. Her poor little bumped
nose would be a warning. But
Papa Dick thought she would,
and said someone ought to be
in the nursery all the time.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp52" id="illus59" style="max-width: 21.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus59.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>“MARY ELLEN MUSTN’T TOUCH!”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“No, no,” said Mama Nan.
“My little Mary Ellen must
grow up able to do right without
being watched. If somebody
sits by her and prevents
her from everything, how can
I ever tell whether she is good
or whether she is bad?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Papa Dick, “I
hope you wont come to grief
a-carrying out your ideas about
your little Mary Ellen.”</p>

<p>The next day after her adventure,
Mary Ellen was left
alone as usual with her playthings.
Her little nose was
black-and-blue, and gave her
a look of not being a specially
good child. Once or twice she
put her little hand up to her
face. “Nosey ache, Dom P’e-do,”
she said to the parrot.</p>

<p>Great-Grandmother Day’s
tall old pier glass stood in the
room. On its low marble
shelf Mama Nan generally
kept a vase filled with flowers.
It was a glass vase, and very
tall and slender. She had
been warned about leaving this
vase in Mary Ellen’s reach.
“She will pull it over some
day,” said Madam Esther, “and
the vase’ll break and she’ll get
cut with the broken glass.”</p>

<p>Mama Nan said “no, she
is to learn not to touch things.”
But after the parrot, the vase
of flowers was the first object
the baby took notice of. Mama
Nan would take a flower
out and give to her, then set
the vase back, shake her head
and say slowly, “Mary Ellen
mustn’t touch!”</p>

<p>“Mary Ellen is a little human
being,” she said, “and knows
just as well as I do that I mean
she is not to touch the vase.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Papa Dick, “and
because she is a little human
being she will some day investigate
that vase for herself.”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>MARY ELLEN DIDN’T LIKE WATER.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And now that day had come.
Mary Ellen sat for a time on
the rug after her mother went
out, holding her rag doll
by one leg. Suddenly she
dropped the doll
and made vigorously
for the
mirror.
She didn’t
hesitate
a
second after getting there.
She reached for the biggest
rose of the lot, grabbed it
by its head and pulled. Over
came the vase, crash, splash,
drench! Mary Ellen gazed
at the puddle. She didn’t
like water. When it spread
out and wet her dress, she
struck at it and drew herself
away. “Notty watty!” she
said. This amused the parrot
and he laughed. “Notty
watty!” she cried, looking up
at him, and struck at it again.
Mary Ellen had never seen
anything struck, but it was a
very fierce little blow she gave
the puddle of drenched flowers.
Then she set off with her big
rose for the open door into the
hall, and up the stairs she
went, and nearly twice as quick
as on the day before.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.</h2>

</div>

<p>“No Kit, no toys. I
think children don’t
need their toys at the beach.”
So said Kit’s mother.</p>

<p>Poor little Kit laid down
the armful she had fetched to
the trunks. “How will I ’muse
me?” said she mournfully.</p>

<p>“O,” said her mother cheerfully,
“there is a wonderful
seashore plaything which I shall
buy you.”</p>

<p>All the way Kit thought
about this “plaything.” It
proved to be a little blue
wooden pail and a spoon.</p>

<p>Kit had never seen outdoors
sand before. “Nurse,”
said she, “Is this sand all
sc’ubbing sand?”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>KIT AND HER PRECIOUS PAIL.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The little blue pail was truly
a “wonderful plaything.” Kit
forgot doll-house and dolls.
She was world-building—mountains
and caves and rivers
and seas; wells and “little
homes” for star-fish and sand-crabs;
great treasure-vaults for
shells and pebbles; gardens of
sea-weed. Other children had
sand-pails. Some days they
toiled in company, and built
long lines of forts. Other days
they built large cities. One
boy dug a deep well and called
it an “oil well.” He sunk a
small tin cup of kerosene in
it and put in rags and set it
afire with a match, and the
whole little crowd jumped up
and down and shouted. But
Kit’s mother and other mothers
put it out and said it was wrong.</p>

<p>On the last day of all Kit
filled her pail with “sc’ubbing
sand” to carry home.</p>

<i>CHAPTER XI.—For Great-grandmama Lois.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Not one of the grandmothers
heard Mary
Ellen on the stairs or on the
landing, and the little creature
patted along by the wall in her
pretty red slippers, past the
door where she had tumbled
in the day before, past Madam
Esther’s, and turned into the
other hall with her rose. This
hall was lighted by a large
window, and as Mary Ellen
felt the sunshine full in her
face she began to smile and
look like herself again. She
pattered along faster, smiling
and smiling, and just as she
came to the last door was on
the point of exploding into a
whole fireworks of laughs and
crows and calls, as was her
way when very much pleased.</p>

<p>“Gum-um!” she called, but
first running into the corner
and backing up close against
the wall. Mary Ellen had no
notion of falling in when <i>this</i>
door opened.</p>

<p>It was at Old Lady Lois’s
room that she had stopped, as
she her little self knew very
well. The door opened instantly.
But the dear old
great-grandmother did not see
the child at first. She looked
all about her, as if very much
alarmed.</p>

<p>“Yosy!” Mary Ellen cried
out. “Yosy, Gum-um!” She
toddled forward and held up
the big wet rose.</p>

<p>Old Lady Lois gathered
her up in her arms and went
in. “Are you up here <i>again</i>,
child?” she said, reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Yosy,” said Mary Ellen.
“Yosy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, pretty rosy,” answered
Old Lady Lois.</p>

<p>“Yosy!” persisted Mary
Ellen.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp52" id="illus62" style="max-width: 21.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus62.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>“YOSY!” SAID MARY ELLEN.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“You best take the flower,
Mrs. Gray,” said Mrs. Camp.
The others had heard the
chirping of the little voice and
had come in to see what had
happened.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see she has
brought it on purpose for <i>you</i>?
I <i>told</i> you she would know us
apart. I knew she would know
<i>you</i> by your <i>flower</i>! She
must have been very observing
when her mother has had
her up here, to know which
was your room.”</p>

<p>“Yosy,” said Mary Ellen,
pushing the wet flower up
against the gentle old face.
This time Old Lady Lois
took the rose and pinned it in
her kerchief. She looked very
pleased. The child seemed
satisfied now. She laid her
little yellow head back on
the white kerchiefed shoulder
and looked around on the
others.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised,”
said Mrs. Persis, contemplating
her, “if she has broken the
vase getting the rose out. Her
dress seems very wet.”</p>

<p>“Notty watty,” said Mary
Ellen.</p>

<p>Madam Esther had gone
down-stairs. She came up
now with Mary Ellen’s father
and mother. Poor Mama Nan
seemed even more terrified and
breathless than on the day before.
“I <i>told</i> you I should
never know another moment’s
peace,” said she.</p>

<p>Papa Dick laughed at her.
“You ought to feel relieved,”
said he. “Here your smart
little Mary Ellen has taught
herself, all alone, how to go
up-stairs.”</p>

<p>But Mama Nan was not
to be comforted in that way.
“What <i>is</i> to be done?” said
she. “She will undertake this
thing every day.” And here
she quite broke down and
began to sob in a miserable
helpless way.</p>

<p>Nobody spoke for a minute.
Then Great-Grandmother Day
said gently, “Just let me take
her in charge, Nancy. I
promise you the child shall
soon go up and down with
perfect safety.”</p>

<p>Mama Nan started up in
fresh terror. “She has got to
learn how to go <i>down</i> too?
Oh, me!”</p>

She sat up and looked after
them, with big eyes. “Mama

</figure>

<p>“Getting down-stairs,”
said Great-grandmother
Day, “doesn’t
come so natural to a child as
getting up-stairs does. And
there is more danger about it.
Mary Ellen ought to be taught
how to do it, and then be
watched. And the sooner the
better, for evidently she is
coming up here when she
pleases.”</p>

<p>The venerable lady stood
her cane up in a corner, took
Mary Ellen from Old Lady
Lois’s lap, gave her a finger
and toddled her along to the
staircase, and placed her on
the floor, her little back to the
stairs. Then she stepped down.
“Come,” said she, “let’s go
down-y, down-y, down-y!”</p>

<p>“See, she is going,” said
Mrs. Persis.</p>

<p>But not exactly going was
Mary Ellen. Great-grandmother
Day had taken hold of
her ankle, and was seeking to
draw the little red-slippered
foot down to the first stair.
Feeling herself going, she
knew not where, Mary Ellen
began to scream, then threw
herself flat on the landing.</p>

<p>“Mercy! I hope Nan doesn’t
hear this!” said Mrs. Camp.</p>

<p>“She doesn’t,” said Mrs.
Lee. “Dick and she have
just driven out of the yard.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Day straightened herself
up, with a red face. “She
will do it all right in a minute
or so,” she said. “Babies are
born with instincts to do these
needful things, just the same
as cats and colts.”</p>

<p>After a long breath or two,
Mrs. Day bent down and tried
again. But Mary Ellen was
really terrified, and screamed
louder than before. This time
she kicked too, and so hard
that her poor Great-grandmother
had to let go.</p>

<p>“Notty Gum-um!” cried the
child.</p>

<p>“Turn her round,” said Mrs.
Camp. “Perhaps <i>her</i> ‘instinct’
is to go frontwards. Nan’s
was.”</p>

<p>And when Mary Ellen was
turned, and could see what she
was doing, and where she was,
and Mrs. Day coaxed again,
“Down-y, down-y, now!” the
wonderful “instinct” began to
stir. She held on to the landing,
behind, with both hands,
gave a quick hitch, and set her
little self on the next step below
all right. And down they
got her at last, with great fun.</p>

<p>“Nan used to go down that
way, so fast she seemed to be
just sliding down,” said Nan’s

scared about Mary Ellen!”</p>

</figure>

<p>Well, the day came at last
when nobody was worried to
find Mary Ellen going up or
coming down quite alone,
holding to the baluster by one
hand, and perhaps a cat on
the other arm. She visited
first one and then another of
her grandmothers, never making
two visits on one trip. She
seemed to be led by the kind
of play she had in her little
mind. In Mrs. Persis’s room
it was the cat-basket, and a
frolic with the cats. In Great-Grandmother
Day’s it was to
ride the cane
cock-horse, like
a little boy,
thumping it
about with
plenty of noise.
Some days she had a flower to
carry to “Yady Yois.” She
went up to Mrs. Lee’s room to
look at pictures. In Madam
Esther’s she picked up buttons;
when Madam Esther,
who loved quiet, heard the
little red slippers stopping at
her door, she hurried to overturn
her button-box. In Mrs.
Camp’s room the little visitor
“made moosic” on the guitar
strings.</p>

<p>It was to get for “Yady
Yois” a big red dahlia that
had blossomed by the gate,
that one day, all by herself,
Mary Ellen clambered down
from the veranda, and took
her first journey out into the
world. She ran skipping over
the green grass, tossing her little
arms and singing “da-da!
da-da!” at the top of her voice.
Her yellow hair was blowing
all about her face and shining
in the September sun and wind.</p>

<p>Her father caught her up, as
he came in through the gate.
“O, ho!” said he. “Running
away, is she? Not a baby any
longer, but an independent little
girl!”</p>

Sun-bonnet.” I
will tell you why.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>BETH.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Her mama had
promised to take her to a picnic,
and for days little Beth
could talk of nothing else.</p>

<p>The night before the picnic
day Beth had caught sight of
little round cakes, tarts, and a
Washington-pie on the pantry
shelf, and when her bed-time
came, and she was up in her
little room with mama, she
asked so many, many questions
that at last mama said:</p>

<p>“There, there, dear, you
must go to sleep, so as to wake
very, very early in the morning.”</p>

<p>After mama had left her,
Beth lay for a long time thinking;
and this awful thought
came to her: suppose she
shouldn’t wake “very, very
early,” and so have no time to
get dressed for the picnic!</p>

<p>In a twinkling Beth was out
of bed. She pulled on her
stockings. She buttoned the
six buttons of each small boot,
and as many buttons of her
dress as she could reach.
Then she felt around in the
dark for her pink calico sun-bonnet.
This she tied tightly
under her chin. Then she
crept softly back into bed.</p>

<p>How mama laughed when
she came into her little daughter’s
room in the morning!
And how everyone else
laughed! And now you know
how Beth came to be called
“Little Sun-bonnet.”</p>

HOW “GUMMA” DRESSED JACK.</h2>

</div>

<p>Jack came trotting into
papa’s room one morning
with two little black stockings
in one hand, two little black
boots in the other, and several
small articles of clothing over
his shoulder.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp56" id="illus67" style="max-width: 32.8125em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>“STOP, PAPA! STOP!” CRIED JACK.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Papa,” he said, “does you
know how to dwess yittle
boys? Gumma’s gone.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, my little
man,” said papa; and he lifted
Jack to his knee, and began to
pull on one small stocking.</p>

<p>“Stop, papa! stop!” cried
Jack. “Dat ain’t <i>a-way</i>!
Gumma don’ do it dat-a-way!”</p>

<p>“Well, how does ‘Gumma’
do it?” asked papa, pausing
for instruction.</p>

<p>“Dis-a-way,” said Jack, taking
up one foot and then carefully
grasping a fat toe in his
chubby hand.</p>

<p>“Here, Mishter Toe, you
an’ your bruzzers mus’ go into
your yittle black house; now
don’ begin to w’iggle. One,
two, <i>free</i>, dere—you go!”
and Jack pulled his stocking
over his five toes, and up to
his knee. Then looking up
into his papa’s face he said:
“See?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said papa, smiling.
“Here goes the other foot.
Now, Mr. Toe, you and all
your brothers”—</p>

<p>“No, no, papa!” cried Jack;
“dat one is <i>Mishis</i> Toe, an’
you mus’ say, ‘all your yittle
<i>sissers</i>.’”</p>

<p>“O, ho!” said papa. “Well
then, <i>Mrs.</i> Toe, and all your
little sisters! One, two, three,
there you go!” and the second
stocking was on.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Jack, “you
mus’ put on the woof.”</p>

<p>“The what?” asked papa.</p>

<p>“The <i>woof</i> to the house,”
and Jack pointed to his boot.</p>

<p>“Oh! the roof. Very well,”
and papa put on the boot and
begun buttoning it with his
fingers.</p>

<p>“Dat ain’t a-way!” cried
Jack again. “You mus’ get
a hooker and lock all ’e’ doors,
so all the yittle bruzzers and
sissers won’ get out ’e’ house
for all day.”</p>

<p>“Now see here, young man,”
said papa, “does grandma go
through with all this rigmarole
every morning?”</p>

<p>“Of courth,” said Jack,
looking at papa with surprised
eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, papa hasn’t the time,
so let me get you into your
clothes <i>quick</i>, before the breakfast
bell rings.”</p>

<p>So Jack had to submit to
being dressed in a hurry, without
his grandmother’s pleasant
romancing.</p>

<p>The minute he got downstairs
he went to his mama and
asked:</p>

<p>“Fen’s my gumma comin’
home?”</p>

<p>“She is coming to-morrow,”
said mama.</p>

<p>“Dat’s nice,” said Jack,
“for” he whispered into mamma’s
ear, “my papa don’ know
how to dwess yittle boys.”</p>

<p>“When it was bed-time the

<p>“And the man would blow
like <i>this</i>,” and Norah puffed
out of the right corner of her

<p>“And his wife would blow

out of the left corner, “but she

<p>Out went the light!</p>

his impudent feathers!” said
he, and flew at him prepared

gave out such a string of victorious

he would cock-a-doodle six

PERCY’S DREAM.</h2>

</div>

<p>On July third Percy’s mama
went up to wake him.</p>

<p>He cried out when she
kissed him, “Oh, mama, I
was having a splendid dream!
I had just put eighteen packs
of fire-crackers in a barrel
under your window, and set
them off, and they were <i>just</i>
going to <i>bang</i>!”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said mama,
laughing. “You will get all
the bang you want to-morrow.”</p>

<p>About ten o’clock mama
missed Percy.</p>

<p>There were “symptoms” of
him everywhere; his little
straw hat on the hall floor,
his top in the dining-room, his
cars in the parlor, his dog in
the porch, his bicycle down by
the front gate. But no Percy.</p>

<p>Finally she went upstairs,
and there was Percy stretched
out on his little brass bed, his
eyes shut tight.</p>

<p>“Why, Percy,” said mama,
as she bent over him, and he
opened his eyes. “Are you
sick?”</p>

<p>“No, Mama, but it’s a
dreadful long time till to-morrow,
and I was trying to piece
out my dream so’s to hear the
bang! Oh, I’m so sorry you
woke me up this morning!”</p>

<p>Little Posy
Pinkham always
declared her
cat un-der-stood what
she said. I could
tell little children
many things to show that house-cats
and house-dogs <i>do</i> un-der-stand
<i>much</i> that is said, and
some day I will.</p>

<p>One morning Posy came
running downstairs, eager to
tell her mama what she had
dreamed, and Posy’s cat at
once pricked up her ears to
listen, for she, too, had had a
dream. Any child who watches
a cat asleep knows cats dream.</p>

<p>“What makes me dream,
mama?” asked Posy.</p>

<p>“O, things you talk about,
hear about, and think about.”</p>

<p>“<i>Meow-wow! ou-ou-wow!</i>”
remarked Posy’s cat. She was
saying that now she understood
the reason of her own dream.</p>

<p>Posy’s cat had a very short,
stubby tail, while she liked
very much better to see long
glossy tails, and wished every
day of her life that her tail was
long and handsome.</p>

<p>In her dream she was sitting
on the gate-post, and had
a long glossy tail
that reached all
the way down
and lay on the
ground, and was
so beautiful that
rats came into the
yard to look at
it and admire it.</p>

<p>“I wish dreams
could come true,”
said Posy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE JOLLY YOUNG ELEPHANT.</h2>

</div>

<p>One day when the Show
was passing through a
village, one of the young trick-elephants
heard a little boy
laugh out suddenly. This
elephant liked little boys; he
had a roguish look himself
and could take a joke, and
never acted “mad” when some
mischievous little visitor fed
him an empty peanut shell.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE YOUNG ELEPHANT’S DREAM.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Turning his mouse-colored
head, the young elephant
looked in at the open door of
the house they were passing.
He flapped his big ears at
what he saw there, and
laughed too.</p>

<p>That night when the show
was over, and he stood in a
row with the other elephants
going to sleep, he thought
again of what he saw in that
open door, and laughed once
more. “That must have been
fun!” he said to himself. “It
must be fun to be a little boy!
That trick was funnier than
any we circus elephants are
taught to do. I wouldn’t
mind being a little boy myself!
I truly wouldn’t!”</p>

<p>And then the jolly young
elephant went to sleep, and
dreamed he could do the little
boy’s trick—and really he
never enjoyed a dream so
much before in all his life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ZERO.</h2>

</div>

<p>If a Polar bear went upright,
he would be as tall as a
man with a boy standing on
his head.</p>

<p>But the Polar bear goes on
all-fours, and so he is nine
feet long instead of nine feet
tall.</p>

<p>A big white Polar bear lived
at the Zoo—a place where
wild animals are kept—in
London, twenty-three years.
He was named Zero, because
he came from the cold Arctic
regions. It was so much
warmer in London that he
was given great cakes of ice
to lie on.</p>

<p>Zero weighed nearly a ton;
but, though he was so large
and so long, his tail was very,
very short, as short as a goat’s
tail.</p>

<p>Unlike all other bears, the
Polar bear’s feet are shod with
hair—short hairs set so close
that one can’t see between them
even with a magnifying glass.
With this hairy sole to his
feet, the Polar bear can walk
on the smoothest ice without
slipping.</p>

<p>Crowds of little London
boys and girls used to go to
the Zoo to watch Zero splash
into his cold-water swimming-bath.
Zero liked his swimming-bath
best of anything in
London—that and the ice.
He never noticed the children
at all.</p>

<p>Polar bears are fondest of
fish for food. Zero was also
fond of strawberries, but he
would not touch the buns and
apples the children tossed in
between the iron bars of his
great cage.</p>
